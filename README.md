BashCode Source (Mac scripting in Terminal)
<br><br>
Bashutil is (a beta of) the entire Bashcode series of programs/scripts, all rolled into a single utility. Additionally, it serves as a "repository", of sorts, for a variety of useful bash code snippets. 
I often find myself needing small snippets of code. For example, if I'm looking for to use a command a certain way (with plenty of parameters), or if I forget the correct syntax of a certain loop, etc., this will serve as a base for me to find all of those snippets. I intend to use a variety of different forms of commands in this utility's source code to get as vast an expanse of code as possible (for future referencing). I hope the source for 'bashutil' helps you as much as the utility itself!
