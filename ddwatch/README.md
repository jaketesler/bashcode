ddwatch
========

Type this line of code into a command prompt before you run an instance of "dd". Leave the command string running. 
<br>In a different window, run the 'dd' command. Every second, a progress update of the transfer will display (essentially sending a SIGINFO to 'dd' once a second).
<br>I just think it's an insanely useful line of code to have in your "back pocket".
